## Abstract

Typically, A spacecraft’s health is monitored by sending telemetry data to the ground
segment. This can create latency and data limitations in identifying sources of electrical
error or malfunction on electronic devices. Early fault detection of onboard electronics of
a satellite can ensure safe operation under nominal conditions. In this thesis, Artificial
intelligence techniques are proposed for a compact infrared payload that monitors the
satellite’s electronics. The payload uses infrared thermography which is a non-invasive
method to monitor faults due to temperature variations on the electronic boards and
it is presently used in several industries such as agriculture, manufacturing etc. Thus,
the different AI anomaly detection techniques for detecting faults on thermal images are
studied. These algorithms are implemented and tested on the first configuration of the
payload which includes the use of Raspberry Pi Zero 2W as the onboard computer. The AI
techniques also show high accuracy on simulated faults for the space payload. Thus, this
thesis contributes to the development of a compact infrared payload that demonstrates
the potential of edge artificial intelligence in space. It also presents the challenges and
limitations of the deployment of AI techniques for processing thermal images on the edge.
The thesis concludes with the advantages of the use of MPSoC as an onboard computer
for the second configuration of the payload.
